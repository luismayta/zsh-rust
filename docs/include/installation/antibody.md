### [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) users

If you're using [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody), install this plugin by doing the following:

1. Add :

```{.sourceCode .bash}
antibody bundle luismayta/zsh-rust
```

to your `.zshrc` where you're adding your other plugins.

2.  Either open a new terminal to force zsh to load the new plugin, or run `antibody bundle luismayta/zsh-rust` in a running zsh session.
3.  Enjoy!
